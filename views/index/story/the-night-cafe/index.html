                    <p>
                        Somewhere in the streets of Japan, a young man was on
                        his way home, having just been fired from his company
                        even after working overtime. It was nearly midnight and
                        the rain was pouring down. The man felt extremely tired.
                        There was not an ounce of motivation in his body. All he
                        wanted was to lie down and sleep, but the road home was
                        very, very long. Then, through the heavy rain, he
                        spotted orange light streaming out from a building on
                        the street corner. The sign above the door read "The
                        Night Café".
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The young man opened the door and went inside. As he
                        entered the tiny café, he was greeted by a thin, old man
                        with gray hair in a suit. The old man held a white towel
                        in his hands, offering it to the young man. He accepted
                        it gratefully and the old man smiled. The old man asked
                        if he would like a seat and menu and the young man
                        accepted, sitting down at the only table in the café.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        From somewhere, the old man pulled out a menu and handed
                        it to the young man. Looking at the menu, the man saw
                        that there were only two things on it: "dessert of the
                        night" and "tea of the night". He tried to ask the old
                        man about it, but the old man simply smiled kindly and
                        assured him that it would be to his taste. The young man
                        chuckled nervously and ordered both. The old man took
                        the menu and then went through a door in the back of the
                        café.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The young man sat there, taking in the beauty of the
                        small café, wondering how he never noticed it before.
                        The interior was made of wood and the cozy, orange
                        lighting was a stark contrast from the blistering cold
                        outside. Everything in the store was shiny and looked to
                        be in perfect condition, as though it was put together
                        the same day. He came to the conclusion that it was
                        probably a completely new store, and felt bad that its
                        opening night ended up having such terrible weather. He
                        doubted that they got any customers apart from himself.
                        Although, they wouldn't be able to serve anybody else,
                        since there was only one table.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Then, just as the young man began to think that it was
                        actually rather odd for there to only be one table in
                        the establishment, the old man returned. He was carrying
                        a plate with a strawberry cheesecake in one hand, and a
                        cup of chamomile tea in the other. The young man thanked
                        him as the old man returned to the door at the back of
                        the café.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As he stuck the tiny dessert fork into the strawberry
                        cheesecake, the faintest memory began solidifying in his
                        mind. Then, as he put the piece of cheesecake in his
                        mouth, it came rushing back, as though viewed on a
                        monitor. A memory of his childhood summers, spent on his
                        grandparents' farm. After helping out on the farm, his
                        grandparents would make him a strawberry cheesecake as a
                        reward for his hard work. He used to sit outside with
                        his grandparents, eating the delicious cake, with a view
                        of the beautiful country area around the farm.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The man looked around himself in confusion. He was
                        surprised to find himself still sitting in the café. For
                        just a moment, he had been absolutely certain that he
                        was out on the old farm again. He shook it off and then
                        decided to have a sip of the tea to wash down the
                        delicious cake. As he lifted his cup, the faint smell of
                        chamomile tea brought another faint memory. He moved the
                        cup to his lips and took a sip of the tea, just the
                        right temperature for him to not burn himself, and
                        suddenly found himself in another memory. This one was
                        more recent; from just a few years ago.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The memory was of a bright winter day. He was on
                        vacation in the snowy mountains with his young daughter.
                        They had just gotten back from skiing and were staying
                        in for the night, at the small cottage they had rented.
                        As his daughter warmed up on an armchair by the fire,
                        covered in warm blankets, he made some tea by the stove.
                        The young man placed the tea on the table between the
                        two armchairs by the fire and sat down in the chair. As
                        he poured the tea in the cups, the aroma of chamomile
                        filled the air.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Once again, he found himself back in the small café. He
                        felt a tear by his eye and swiftly wiped it away. How
                        could it be that he had never looked back upon those
                        times before? They were just minor things at the time,
                        but now they seemed like the happiest times in his life.
                        Somehow, the sadness and depression that he had felt
                        earlier, as he had walked through the freezing rain,
                        water sloshing in his shoes, feeling the water soaking
                        his clothing all the way through, was washed away by
                        nostalgia. Now that he thought about it, he was
                        completely dry. As a matter of fact, he felt warm. When
                        had this happened? He couldn't have been in the café for
                        more than a few minutes.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        He looked down at his plate, intending to take another
                        bite of the strawberry cheesecake, but the plate was
                        completely empty. Only a few small crumbs remained
                        behind. He looked to his cup for some chamomile tea, but
                        found it, too, completely empty. The man looked up in
                        search of the old man who had served him, but found the
                        café to still be empty.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As he looked around the room, the man began to notice
                        various things which were certainly irregular, though he
                        hadn't considered it earlier. Like there only being one
                        seat and the menu only containing two items. Despite
                        these confusing things, the man still felt comfortable,
                        relaxed, and warm. Not the slightest bit of fear or
                        panic.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The man looked out the window and noticed that the rain
                        had stopped, though he couldn't remember when. Then, in
                        the reflection of the window, he saw a figure behind
                        him. He turned and found, to his surprise, the old man
                        standing by the side of his table once more. Perhaps he
                        had come back out from the door in the back without him
                        noticing.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The old man smiled at him and asked if he enjoyed the
                        meal. The young man, still slightly confused, quickly
                        righted himself and said that yes, he had. The old man
                        took the empty plate and cup, and walked to the door in
                        the back. He then returned a minute later with a
                        receipt. The young man took the receipt and looked at it
                        while reaching for his wallet. He paused when he saw the
                        receipt, however. It had already been paid in full. At
                        the bottom of the receipt was a message, written in
                        cursive, with a small heart next to it. It read “Thank
                        you for everything.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When the young man asked who had paid it, the older
                        gentleman told him that a young girl had come in earlier
                        in the evening and asked to pay for the next customer.
                        Whoever it was, the young man thought to himself, he was
                        incredibly thankful to them. For that one night, he had
                        felt the happiest he had in years. It was like he had
                        regained the will to live his life, lost so long ago.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Looking out the window, he was surprised to see the red
                        sky in the distance. Somehow, he had lost track of time,
                        staying there all night. He turned and bowed to the old
                        gentleman, thanking him for the incredible food and
                        service. The young man felt a sense of unbridled joy and
                        love towards the small café. He decided that he would
                        come back as soon as possible and spread the word of

                        man chuckled kindly to himself as, ready to face the
                        world once more, the young man closed the door to The
                        Night Café.
