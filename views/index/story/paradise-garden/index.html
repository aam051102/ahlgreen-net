                    <p>
                        In a far off kingdom, there once lived a princess,
                        fairer and kinder than any other. One day, the princess
                        fell sick. Her father, the king, brought men of medicine
                        from all the lands, but none could heal her. After many
                        moons, the princess succumbed to her illness.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The king wished to bury her in a place as impossibly
                        beautiful as her. However, there was not an inch of land
                        in his kingdom of which he did not know, and he had
                        never seen such a place. He thought to reach out to the
                        nearby territories, but he dared not let her leave is
                        sight, for he was soon to follow suit himself.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Thus, he resigned to bury her in the palace gardens'
                        dull grass plains. He dug the grave himself and placed
                        her body in it. When he had laid her to rest, he began
                        to dig another next to it. He would make sure that, when
                        he, too, succumbed, that was where he would lay.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As the days passed, he visited her grave every day. And
                        every day, he ensured that his own was ready. Slowly,
                        almost carefully, flowers began springing up around the
                        princess's resting place.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        At first, merely the most common flowers appeared,
                        dithering the area with small, white and yellow petals.
                        Soon, however, the previously plain grass gardens had
                        begun blossoming purple flowers with petals like silk,
                        which seemed to shimmer in the sunlight. And still, it
                        all seemed to emanate from the spot where the princess
                        lay. The grass seemed to grow faster than ever, covering
                        up patches of dirt with a solid layer of green. Somehow,
                        despite its intense growth, the grass remained short, as
                        though freshly cut.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The people of the capital began to take notice of the
                        magnificent palace gardens, its many vibrant colors
                        illuminating the faces of the passersby. The king soon
                        took notice and opened the gates, which had encapsulatd
                        the palace gardens for many years. As more and more
                        people came to see the fair garden, it seeemed to grow
                        with more vigor than ever before, as though spurred on
                        by the adoring crowds.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        One morning, the entire capital awoke to find that a
                        stream of the clearest water had appeared in the garden
                        from seemingly nowhere. It flowed between the many
                        flowers with ease, settling as a small lake close by the
                        two graves located in the center of the massive bouquet.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Though new and unique plants still blossomed, the growth
                        of the flowers seemd to slowing. The king knew that his
                        time was soon to come. With the passing of the second
                        equinox, on the day that his daughter died, the king did
                        not rise from his bed in the palace. Nor the next. Nor
                        ever again.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        As he had requested, he was placed in the grave next to
                        his daughter. Over the years, people have continued to
                        visit the magnificent garden. New flowers still appear,
                        placed by people from all walks of life, coming from all
                        across the world to witness the impossible beauty of the
                        garden.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Now, every year, on the anniversary of their deaths, the
                        people celebrate the girl and her loving father by
                        gathering in the paradise gardens and placing the
                        prettiest flowers from the garden on their graves.
