                    <p>
                        Greetings. I am The Scribe. I will be your guide through
                        this story. This particular tale favors the kindhearted
                        elf, Lýli (<i>lie</i>-li), as she makes a peculiar
                        discovery.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In a faraway land, there is a continent covered in a
                        single, continuous forest. Its unfathomable beauty is
                        unrivaled, and its colors are said to be more vibrant
                        than even a rainbow. Through it flows water so clean
                        that it can be drunk directly from the rivers. In this
                        magical forest lives just one intelligent species; the
                        elves. Their beauty, long age, high magical prowess and
                        intelligence may seem a cause for strife amongst the
                        races, but none exists. Each race supplies the others
                        with what they lack, creating a perfectly codependent
                        balance.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In the center of this forest, by the foot of a massive
                        mountain, lies an elven village. To protect the sanctity
                        of the land, the elves build their homes in the
                        treetops, allowing the forest to remain in a perfect
                        state for eternity. A young elf girl, Lýli, lives in
                        this village. She is currently out picking mushrooms and
                        berries for lunch a little ways away from the village.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Just as she picks the last few berries off a bush, she
                        hears the small yelp of a nearby animal. Curious, she
                        moves by some nearby trees, expertly locating the source
                        of the sound. There, in a small clearing, is a tiny
                        nine-tailed fox. She notices that its foot appears stuck
                        in the hole of a wooden log. Slowly and calmly, she
                        walks towards the animal. Kneeling down, she reassures
                        it that everything will be okay.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Expertly, and with extreme care not to harm the small
                        animal, she holds its tiny foot and pulls it upwards,
                        out of the hole. The animal stumbles a bit before
                        jumping off the log. The tiny fox turns around to face
                        Lýli, squeals happily, and runs off into the woods.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        With a relieved smile on her face, she stands back up
                        and walks towards the nearby river, carrying her woven
                        basket of berries and mushrooms. No paths exist through
                        the forest, so she follows the river home, as per usual.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In the small clearing around the river, the golden sun
                        makes her beauty as evident as the forests. Light skin,
                        a kind smile, bright blonde hair cut perfectly to
                        shoulder length, and the telltale sign of an elf;
                        elongated ears with pointed tips. The ground, covered in
                        grass of a perfect length, despite never being cut,
                        softens every step of her bare feet as she takes in the
                        ambience of the forest, home to so many different animal
                        species. Due to the hot climate, the elves wear very
                        little clothing. All clothing is woven from the whitest
                        spider silk, only occasionally using thinly cut pieces
                        of metal, provided by the best dwarven blacksmiths,
                        alongside a variety of flowers, to create intricate
                        visual designs.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Lýli proceeds along the beautiful riverbend. However, as
                        she passes by the foot of a mountain, she notices
                        something out of the corner of her eye, which causes her
                        to stop abruptly. Though the area around the foot of the
                        mountain is warm and filled with the most beautiful
                        birds in the forest, a chill runs through her. There, in
                        the foot of the mountain, is a massive cave opening. A
                        cave opening, which Lýli is absolutely certain was not
                        there yesterday.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Without taking her eyes off the cave, Lýli slowly places
                        the woven basket on the ground. Walking closer to the
                        opening, she begins to notice a faint, green light
                        emanating from inside the cavern. If there is one thing
                        greater than elven intellect, it is their sense of
                        curiosity; A curiosity which now seemed to push Lýli
                        towards the cave opening. Finally, she stands directly
                        in front of the entrance. The cave seems to go quite far
                        into the mountain and she can now see that the green
                        light is coming from moss growing all over the walls.
                        This cave must have been here for a very long time. Lýli
                        wonders how she could have missed it.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Lýli takes a step into the cave. She then takes several
                        more. The cave is unlike anything she has seen before.
                        It is not the perfect beauty of the forest outside, but
                        beautiful in its own way. The light from the mossy walls
                        make her feel calm and comforted, despite the curious
                        surroundings. After walking for some time, she finds
                        herself in a larger cave. Located in each of the corners
                        of the cave is a large pillar. In the center, directly
                        in front of Lýli, is a perfectly square plate.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        On closer inspection, all the pillars in the room seem
                        to be engraved with complex markings. As Lýli walks to
                        the plate in the center, something odd begins to happen
                        to the pillars. Each pillar lights up its engravings;
                        each with its own color. The patterns of light cascade
                        across the floor, finally lining up on the center plate.
                        Some of the patterns line up perfectly, mixing their
                        colors to create new ones.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As Lýli looks at the patterns, all lined up, she begins
                        to recognize the shapes. Each shape is a different mass
                        of land, and each mass of land is outlined in a
                        different color. One, in particular, sticks out to her.
                        A small segment within the elven forest is outlined in a
                        harsh white. Suddenly, a shift in her surroundings
                        removes Lýli's focus from the plate. Where there was
                        once a cave ceiling, the black of night surrounds her.
                        Her eyes adjusting, she realizes that she is no longer
                        inside of the cave.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A light breeze drifts across her face, as her eyes widen
                        at the beautiful sky, covered in bright stars. Below her
                        feet, grassy plains cover the ground that was once a
                        cave floor. To her right, a river flows off the side of
                        a cliff, forming a beautiful waterfall, shimmering in
                        the light of the moon. The otherwise beautiful landscape
                        does not capture her attention, for to her left is the
                        most magnificent castle Lýli has ever seen.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Overgrown by plants and flowers in many colors, the
                        massive castle stands tall in the plains. The walls of
                        the castle, once covered in the many colors of life, are
                        now a faded white. Here, too, the plants seem to light
                        up Lýli's path in the dark of night, as she heads for
                        the castle. The light from the pillars fades behind her,
                        leaving the castle as the only shining light.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Reaching the castle, Lýli proceeds through the open gate
                        and up a large street. Wooden stalls line both the sides
                        of the street. The plant life in the market street seems
                        to have been more active than the outside of the castle.
                        While Lýli cannot help but adore the beautiful flowers
                        and plants, a tiny part of her mind can't help but
                        wonder where the creators of such a grand castle could
                        have gone. Why would they leave such a beautiful place?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Lýli continues toward the center of town, where a large
                        tower stands clear above all the other buildings.
                        Proceeding up the street, she passes through a small
                        plaza with an empty fountain in the center. In the
                        middle stands a white marble statue of a beautiful woman
                        with long, flowing hair. Nine statues of babies are
                        placed by her feet. All but one of them are covered in
                        vines, almost completely obscuring them.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        She proceeds past the plaza and into an area with only
                        empty buildings, overgrown by vines and flowers as
                        beautiful as the ones in the elven forest. Small pieces
                        of golden pollen float in the air like fireflies,
                        lighting up the area even more. If she stopped to look
                        closely, she may have noticed that they were not truly
                        moving, but merely hovering in place. A while later,
                        Lýli reaches the gate to the inner castle. As though led
                        by the hand, she walks through the gate and into a long
                        hallway.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The hallway is beautifully carpeted with red and golden
                        cloth, and many intricate wooden doors line the hallway;
                        all of them open. Ignoring the open doors, the beautiful
                        carpet, and the increasing amount of foliage covering
                        the walls, she continues further down the hallway. Along
                        the way, she passes many more statues, as well as
                        several paintings, though she takes little notice at
                        this point.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        After walking for some time, she reaches the first
                        closed door and stops in front of it. Here, in the
                        center of the castle, the plant life is more active than
                        anywhere else. Thick vines with sprouting flowers in all
                        the colors of the rainbow cover the edges of the door,
                        as though trying to break through.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Lýli slowly moves to place her hand on the door, but
                        before she can push it open, the entire door lights up
                        and opens into a massive room. Nine thrones stand in the
                        back of the room, barely visible behind all of the plant
                        life. One throne stands untouched and pristine. In the
                        center is an inverted pyramid, seemingly made of colored
                        glass. Beneath it sits a solitary figure.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Lýli approaches the figure and finds him to be a very
                        old man. He is sitting on the ground; legs crossed.
                        Free-flowing cloth robes his body. The faintest trace of
                        magic emanates from his body. He is barely alive, but
                        unable to do anything. Kind as she is, she reaches out
                        to him, wishing to transfer some of her own magic, so
                        that he may live. If she had stopped to think, she may
                        have chosen differently.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        She reassures the old man, like she did the nine-tailed
                        fox, that everything will be okay. As she touches his
                        arm, the man's eyes slowly move to look up at her. As
                        she looks into his eyes, the very universe is reflected
                        in them, more beautiful than even the elven forest. As
                        she stares into my eyes, she realizes that she cannot
                        move. I reach for her arm and grasp it tightly. Her
                        magic flows through my body.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        There is no point in being angry with me. I understand
                        that you may resent me for deceiving you, but that will
                        do you no good now. I let go of her arm and she drops to
                        the floor. With her magic gone, she is as good as dead.
                        Magic is a necessary part of all life.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Lýli does not know what I have done. How could she? We
                        lived life in secret, forced to write our stories of the
                        outside world, but never to see it or interact with it.
                        Never to live it.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Though we could nudge certain things to fit our stories,
                        we would never take part. Pathetic, don't you think? My
                        magic is far greater than any other. Why should I spend
                        my life writing stories about some random, weak
                        villagers becoming great heroes and defeating “the great
                        evil?” So I used my magic to create better stories. I
                        created magnificent forests, mountains that reached for
                        the heavens, and a species more intelligent than
                        anything in existence. The others were not happy. A
                        misuse of the power entrusted in me. A horrific insult
                        towards Mother.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You must understand that there is not a single one of
                        them that can defeat me. However, even my magic is
                        incomparable to their combined power. They drained me of
                        my magic and forced this field into a state of magical
                        permanence. No magic within the field at the time of the
                        spell can move. I managed to seal what little magic I
                        had within me before the spell was complete, but barely
                        enough to keep my body alive. That is why I brought her
                        here. Lýli, that is. I hope you did not forget about
                        her. She was my external source of magic.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Now, I leave Lýli in the very place I have sat for so
                        long. At last, I leave the field. I am free from my
                        chains, but still, I am forced to scribe. It is not
                        simply a task, but the very object of our life. Without
                        it, our souls will shatter. Just another one of Mother's
                        humiliating gestures. Now, I will set out to find her.
                        No more scribing. I will be truly free.
                    </p>
