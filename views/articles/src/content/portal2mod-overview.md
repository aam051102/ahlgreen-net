# Portal 2 Modding - Overview

These articles function as a tutorial for the creation of new Portal 2 mods. Feel free to direct questions to me directly.

This tutorial assumes that you have Steam and own Portal 2 on Steam. It will not be possible to follow this tutorial otherwise. I will also not be guiding you on basic downloads, unzipping, and installations.

This page covers a simple overview of what we'll be making, as well as the one-time setup, which is necessary before you can start doing anything. You will only need to perform this setup _once_ on your device, and not once per mod.
