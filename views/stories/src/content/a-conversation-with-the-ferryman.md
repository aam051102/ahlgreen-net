# A Conversation With The Ferryman

The man stood up in the long wooden boat to greet the newcomer. His hooded and robed appearance seemed to disturb the pale old man.

"Greetings," he said.

The stranger nearly tripped on a rock as he stumbled down the riverside.

"H-hello," the stranger said, his voice quaking.

"Payment, please."

"A-ah, right, yes, of course. Uh, payment. Yes."

The ragged-looking mans hands shook as he fumbled around his pockets.

"Payment. Please."

"Yes, um-uh-yes, I-I have it."

He pulled out one small coin from the very bottom of his pockets. Hands trembling, he handed it to the man in the boat.

The ferryman looked down at the coin for a moment.

His voice was cold, almost upset as he spoke.

"This is not enough."
